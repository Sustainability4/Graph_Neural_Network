# Graph_Neural_Network
Graph Neural Networks can be divided into three different ideas : 1. Graph Data Structures 2. Graph Theory 3. Neural Networks. Application of Graph Neural networks can be understood from the apps like Uber Eats uses it for food recommendations, Pinterest deployed PinSage graph neural netwrok, Twitter uses graph neural network to detect fake news, Its uses can be seen in field of Computer Vision and NLP. It is highly relevant in medical fields where scientist are using graph neural netwroks to combine the drugs and adjudge its side effects.

Some benchmark datasets are Imagenet, Cora, Open Graph Benchmarks, TU Datasets. 

Some python library : Spektral (based on tensorflow 2 and keras), Graph Nets libarary from deep minds
